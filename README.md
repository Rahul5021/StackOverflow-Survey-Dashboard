- Very High: Salary > [(Q3-Q1)*1.5+Q3]

## Slicers Present

The dashboard includes slicers for filtering data based on the following criteria:

- **Age Category:** Users can filter respondents based on age categories, including Baby, Youth, Adults, and Seniors.
- **Remote Work Category:** Users can filter respondents based on their remote work status, distinguishing between those who work remotely and those who do not.
- **Developer Category:** Users can filter respondents based on their developer category, such as Full-stack developer, Front-end developer, Back-end developer, etc.

To use the slicers, simply select the desired category or categories to filter the data accordingly and refine your analysis.
